        Ayurveda is the art and science of holistic healing. It is an immersive
        experience that helps to create and maintain an equilibrium between the
        body, mind and soul. Would you rather pop a few pills and feel better or
        create a space for healing, nourshing and rejuvenating? At Anjaneyam, we
        focus on healing the underlying root cause rather than treating only the
        symptoms of an ailment.
