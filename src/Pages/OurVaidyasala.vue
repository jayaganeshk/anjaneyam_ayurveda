      History of Anjaneyam

    <div class="ma-8">
      Sri Anjaneyam Ayurveda Vaidyasala, Kumbakonam is just a small
      reciprocation to my guru Dr. Sanal Chandran, BAMS who brought me into this
      beautiful world of Ayurveda. He always says the solution to todays erratic
      human life is following the traditions of Ayurveda dharma. Rishis of
      Bharat did not just contemplate a set of rules to follow. They gave us
      balance in physical and mental wellbeing. Adopting the local tradition,
      paramparaya dishes, dress codes and practices will simply lead us to
      disease-free living. My Guru at Anjaneyam Ayurveda Hosptial, Payyanur,
      Kerala not just treats patients but also gives them the knowledge of Yoga,
      Kalari, our dharma and its Samskaras. He also practices traditional way of
      agriculture, cattle farming, and medicine preparation. Just like our
      Vaidyasala in kumbakonam, there are other branches at Andrapradesh and
      Madhyapradesh where the same tradition is being followed.
